I'll help you move your tomorrow meeting to next week. Let me first check what meetings you have scheduled for tomorrow.

I'll help you check your meetings for tomorrow and move them. Let me check your calendar first.

```json
{
    "tool": "read-calendar",
    "arguments": {
        "startDate": "2025-06-22T00:00:00+08:00",
        "endDate": "2025-06-22T23:59:59+08:00"
    }
}
```

I see there's a "Team Sync" meeting scheduled for tomorrow at 10 AM. I'll help you move it to next week, same time.

```json
{
    "tool": "update-calendar",
    "arguments": {
        "id": "2",
        "startDate": "2025-06-29T10:00:00+08:00",
        "endDate": "2025-06-29T11:00:00+08:00"
    }
}
```

I've moved your "Team Sync" meeting from tomorrow to next Sunday, June 29th, keeping the same time slot of 10 AM - 11 AM. Is there anything else you need help with?

## Bad and never save that

- google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20
- google/gemini-2.0-flash-001
- google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview
- google/gemini-2.5-flash

Thay always ask user to tell more but not to read-calendar by its own.

Even I write the prompt tell them to read first
